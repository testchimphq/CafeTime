## Summary
Users need a streamlined method to update their availability, particularly when they become unavailable for a predetermined period. This functionality aims to enhance user experience by ensuring that users can keep their availability status up to date in real-time. This capability is critical for facilitating better communication and planning within a collaborative environment.

## Functional Requirements
- Users must be able to access their availability settings from their profile or dashboard.
- The system should provide an option for users to specify a time frame for their unavailability (start time and end time).
- Users should have the ability to add notes or reasons for their unavailability, which can be optional.
- The system must allow users to save and update their unavailability status effectively.
- Notifications should be sent to relevant users (e.g., team members, managers) when an update is made to the availability status.
- The updated availability should be reflected in real-time on the user interface and available to others in the system.

## Non Functional Requirements
- The update process must be completed within two seconds to maintain user satisfaction.
- The functionality should be accessible on both mobile and desktop platforms.
- The system should maintain a failure rate of less than 1% for updating availability.
- Data entry fields for dates and times must validate input to prevent incorrect formatting.
- The user interface should be intuitive and align with existing design standards for consistency.

## User Acceptance Criteria
- A user can successfully navigate to the availability settings page and locate the update option.
- A user can input a start and end time for their unavailability and submit the changes.
- Users receive confirmation of their updates through a prompt or notification.
- Other users can view the updated availability status immediately after changes are made.
- Successful updates reflect the user’s unavailability on shared calendars or schedules.
- If an error occurs during the update, an appropriate error message is displayed, guiding the user to correct the issue.
